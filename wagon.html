          <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
          <BR>
          <p3><b>The Mercedes-Benz G-Class, sometimes called G-Wagen,is a mid-size four-wheel drive luxury SUV manufactured by Magna Steyr (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch) in Austria and sold by Mercedes-Benz. In certain markets, it has been sold under the Puch name as Puch G. The G-Wagen is characterised by its boxy styling and body-on-frame construction. It uses three fully locking differentials, one of the few vehicles to have such a feature. The G-class was developed as a military vehicle from a suggestion by the Emperor of Iran (at the time a significant Mercedes shareholder) to Mercedes and offered as a civilian version in 1979. In this role it is sometimes referred to as the "Wolf". The Peugeot P4 was a variant made under licence in France with a Peugeot engine. The first military in the world to use it was the Argentine Army (Ej√©rcito Argentino) beginning in 1981 with the military model 461.</b></p3>
